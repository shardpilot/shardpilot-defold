# Changelog

## v0.2.0 — unreleased — early alpha

- BREAKING: built-in helpers emit canonical wire event names. `session_start()`
  emits `app.session_started` and `screen_view(...)` emits `app.screen_view`.
  Helper API names are unchanged.
- Generates a UUIDv7 anonymous ID on first init and persists it through
  `sys.get_save_file("shardpilot", "identity")` with `sys.save`/`sys.load`,
  degrading gracefully to in-memory state when the Defold `sys` API is
  unavailable.
- Adds `set_consent(analytics_granted)` with tri-state consent
  {unknown, granted, denied} persisted next to the anonymous ID. Denied drops
  events at enqueue and clears the pending queue. Explicit decisions are
  reported fire-and-forget to `POST {ingest_url}/v1/consent` over the same
  authenticated transport as the events batch.
- This is an early alpha pre-release. The API is unstable and may change before v1.

## v0.1.1 — 2026-05-23 — early alpha

- Defold dependency URL updated to recommend the v0.1.1 archive.
- This is an early alpha pre-release. The API is unstable and may change before v1.
